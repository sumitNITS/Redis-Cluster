## What is HAProxy and Why it is important?

HAProxy is a widely used open-source load balancer and proxy server software that can be used to improve the availability and scalability of applications by distributing the traffic across multiple servers. In the case of a Redis cluster with three master nodes and three slave nodes, HAProxy can provide several benefits mentioned below:

- Load balancing: HAProxy can distribute incoming traffic to multiple Redis nodes in a round-robin or weighted manner, ensuring that the load is evenly distributed across all nodes. This can prevent any individual node from becoming a bottleneck and can improve the overall performance and availability of the Redis cluster.

- High availability: HAProxy can be configured to detect when a Redis node goes down and automatically redirect traffic to another node in the cluster. This can ensure that the Redis cluster remains highly available even if one or more nodes fail.

- Security: HAProxy can act as a reverse proxy and terminate SSL connections, adding an extra layer of security to the Redis cluster.

This "ansible" section mainly contains install-haproxy.yml and haproxy-role which is created using ansible-galaxy (ansible-galaxy init haproxy-role). 
The haproxy-role structure is given below, one can modify each section based on the specific requirements.

<pre>
├── defaults
│  └── main.yml
├── handlers
│   └── main.yml
├── meta
│  └── main.yml
├── tasks
│   └── main.yml
├── templates
│   ├── haproxy.conf.j2
├── tests
│   └── test.yml
└── vars
    └── main.yml
</pre>

This ansible role can be used to Install and Configure haproxy in different linux distro's including CentOS and Ubuntu.
In order To use HAProxy with the Redis cluster, the configuration file of HAProxy needs to be modified to listen on a specific port and to route traffic to the correct Redis nodes. The configuration file (haproxy.conf.j2) includes a list of backend servers with their IP addresses and port numbers. At the time of test I have kept the redis master servers as the backend servers (Inside "vars", main.yml file).  

Once the configuration file is updated the HAProxy service can be started and tested to ensure that it is correctly distributing traffic to the Redis nodes. Check the image below for analyzing the work done. By using HAProxy with a Redis cluster one can improve the performance, availability, and security of Redis service, hence it makes Redis more reliable and scalable.
